                    <h2> Our Services</h2>
                    <h3>Mineral Exploration & Evaluation</h3>
                        <p>The Regional Geology Department of the Agency primarily carries out geological mapping which is aimed at providing 
                            information on the distribution of various rock types present on the country’s landscape. Such information is useful
                             for the identification and development of mineral resources, land use, planning and infrastructural development.
                              It also provides services on sedimentology, stratigraphy, paleontology, palynology, basin analysis, as well as 
                              geospatial services on remote sensing and photo interpretation and structural studies.

                                The continuous mapping on various scales is done, primarily for the determination of the nation’s rock formations
                                 for use in all aspects of the government natural resources policies.</p>

                    <h3>Geotechnical & Drilling Services</h3>
                    <p>  Drilling is a very vital process in the exploration – minerals, water and foundations. It is the culmination of the mineral
                         exploration process whereby the third dimension of a prospect, the subsurface geometry is defined and the information
                          obtained from drill logs can be used for the estimation of resource size.</p>
